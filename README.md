# Sentiment Analysis on User Reviews

This repository contains a Python script for sentiment analysis on a dataset of user reviews. The script loads the dataset from a CSV file, cleans the data, performs basic text preprocessing, analyzes the sentiment of each review, and generates a summary report showing the distribution of sentiments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nbx0021/sentiment_analysis
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Replace `path_to_your_file.csv` in the script with the actual path to your CSV file containing user reviews.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

3. After running the script, you'll find the summary report saved as `summary_report.md`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- textblob

## Dataset Format

The dataset should be provided in CSV format with at least two columns: 'id' and 'review'.
